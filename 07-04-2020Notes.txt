1. What are the basic requirements for building an End to End Web Application?
2. What are the challenges in Modern Web Development?
     - Unified UX
     - Fluid UX
     - Loosely Coupled and Extensible
     - Simiplified Deployment and Upgrades
3. What is Solution?
     - Better to build  "SPA" Single Page Applications
       or "Progressive Applications"

4. What is SPA?
    - A single page application allows user to access everything from one page.
    - User will stay on one page and can get access to everything from the page.
    - New details are added to page without reloading the complete page.
           Ex: Twitter

5. What is Progressive Web Application?
   - A website will have an app like experience even in a browser.
   - Website will not look like a page, you will have the feel of an app in browser.

6. How to Build a SPA or Progressive Web App?
  - Can web Build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery? : Yes
  - Then what is problem with JavaScript and Jquery,
     why we are moving towards new technologies?

7. What is Problem with JavaScript and JQuery?
   
Evolution:
- Network in computing system started in early 1960's
- The first computer network was ARPANET  [Advanced Research Projects Agency Network] introduced by US-DOD.
- CERN Labs [Council for European Research and Neucler] introduced Internet
              Browser	: Mosaic 
              Markup	: GML, SGML
              Client Side   : ECMA Script
- Tim Berners Lee [works for CERN] introduced the concept of Web [Web is a portion of internet with restricted access]. He introduced a language for web called "HTML".
- In early 1994  Netscape Communications developed a Browser for Web called "Nescape Communicator"

        Browser	: Netscape
        Markup Lang	: HTML
        Client Side	: ECMA Script

- A group called IETF [Internet Engineering Task Froce] took responsibility of developing HTML and released so many features into HTML like links, forms etc..
        ECMA Script was unable to handle advanced HTML features introduced in early days, like forms.

- In 1996 Netscape appointed an Scripting Expert to build a client side script for Netscape Browser in order to handle HTML and its improving features. His name is  "Brendan Eich". He developed a script by name "Mocha", which was later re-named as "Live Script".

- Netscape Company is not an expert of Scripting Languages, hence they given the responsibility of mantaining and improving "Live Script" to a company called "Sun Micro Systems" [ was popular at that time with their language called JAVA]. 

- Hence SunMicro Systems re-named the script as "JavaScript".
	JavaScript - Designed by Brendan Eich
		  - Maintianed by SunMicro
		  - Standards of ECMA
- 1998 Microsoft releated OS - Windows - 98 free browser "Internet Explorer".
	Uses   : HTML
	Client : JavaScript
- 2001 Netscape stopped its services and handed over JavaScript to ECMA.
          Every Browser started extention of JavaScript by its Own. This leads to "Browser Incompatibility"

- 2006 John Resig  introduced a library for JavaScript to reduce compatibility issues, which is known as "JQuery".
