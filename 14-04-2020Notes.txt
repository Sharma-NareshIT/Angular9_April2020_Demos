- TypeScript Components

1. Core TypeScript Compiler
    - It compiles the typescript code

    - The keywords, types and other service related options are verified from language service.

3. Standalone Compiler [tsc.ts]
   - It Transcompiles the TS code into JavaScript.
                         TS --> JS

     - Shim is small library
     - IT brings an new API to an older environment.
     - It reduces the compatibility issues
     - It makes your code OS neutral
     - It makes your code cross platform
     - Shim creates plugin called "Polyfills"

6. Managed Language Service
     - It Contains a library which can run on every OS
     - It contains cross platform library
     - It comprises of functions which are understandable to every device, browser and OS 

7. Editors 
    - It provides a support for various editors which are used to build, debug, test and deploy applications.
